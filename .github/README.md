## ðŸ”¤ Translation needed!
I need help translating this addon! If you notice your language is not supported and you would like to help, then you can take a look at [this file](https://github.com/sandervspl/BuffTimers/blob/master/Locales.lua#L17) and DM me the translation for the text in quotes. I will mention your name in the changelog if you want <3

Some translations have been done by AI. For these languages, I need help with correcting.
